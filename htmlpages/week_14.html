          <h6>This week we received new assignment! It's an app to handled 
            Apprentices' Homework, tickets for blockers and apprentices' daily
            reports. We're working in the planning section, it developed questions like
            <i>What is a RoadMap?</i>, <i>What is the difference between Workflow and Roadmap?</i>,
            <i>How to build a UML diagram class?</i>. Another important situation is that I'm 
            preparing to have an interview. I'm working in my speach to introduce myself.  
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Resume and interview's preparetion</h3>
        <p>This section's interesting because 
            I can prepare or have an idea about what to 
            answer in an interview. It's pretty difficult 
            to think of an answer when you are nervous. Then I decided 
             to select some questions and think an answer. It works
             especially with the questions where I have to think in a situation.
             Ther could be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When You Solved a Problem</li>
            <li>When You Overcame a Challenge</li>
            <li>When You Made a Mistake</li>
            <li>When You Worked With a Team</li></ul>
        <p>In the stories of solving a problem or making mistakes I had some
            blockers thinking about what could I say without showing a bad example. I decired
            this answers:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> When You Made a Mistake: When I have an Error in my code, I Usually use debugging tools. 
                    I learned to interpret the common RunTime or compile errors. 
                    I can say that sometimes is tricky to find where the error is. 
                    With some persistence and sometimes a couple or extra eyes or
                    a break, we can find it faster. 
                </p></li>
            <li>When You Solved a Problem:
                <p> I haven't had any conflicts with my peers or another job. However,
                    I could say that most problems appear when someone isn't 
                    communicating about their part of the job, feelings, or understanding. 
                    If that happens I usually try to make some direct questions to understand
                    what is happening. 
                </p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I didn't write the whole answers I built. Those above are enough because they 
            were the most complicated to answer. I can see this exercise works well
            to think deeply about something that can work for the interview. 
        </p>
        <p>Then, I worked in a small speach to introduce myself. It also was pretty difficult 
             to build, because you should thing in some features, experience and values that
             describe what they need.
        </p>
        <p>Speach to introduce myself:</p>

          <h3 class="subtitle">Software Development Plan</h3>
            <p>This week we started a new project. It's going to be an app to use in the 
                apprentice program. I worked on making the UML diagram class. Our first 
                approach was to have the user roles with inheritance. After some 
                research, we realized that wasn't a good idea. We can simply make a file 
                with an Enum to set up the kind of user we have. 
            </p>
            <p>Also, we selected the technology we want to use to develop the app. I think
                this is an important section. We just have a month to develop the app, 
                so we should know our technology to focus attention on the features instead
                of learning new technology.
            </p>
            <p> Finally, the whole research we had to do for this app. In this section,
                we needed to understand how to do a roadmap and a workflow. I helped
                build a roadmap, it chose the Agil product web map. We think this fits 
                our project because it has springs every term to re-evaluate features
                based on feedback. Also, the workflow is based on agile practices. We're
                going to meet constantly to check the advance every day. Every week we'll 
                have demostrations to show our app.  
            </p>
