          <h6>This week we work in our last Lightning-talk and I finished my first project 
            in HyperSkill. The project was the Cinema REST using Spring and new configurations
            that I learned. My Lightning-talk was about Mavel. It was a cool presentation. I am 
            happy because I finished a project in HyperSkill. 
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">HyperSkills</h3>
          <p>All this week I had been working on the Cinema REST project for the last 
            4 weeks. It was a large process because I had too much theory to learn. 
            I have to review it again to practice for interviews later. I felt this program
            is developing new and helpful abilities. In the stages of HyperSkill's project
            I didn't need too much help to understand what I need it to do. I only had an internal
            error so in the REST answer was a 500 error that I took some time to fix it. 
          </p>
          <p> In the app ToDo I had some mistakes that I can understand today Why
            that code was wrong. Those were a blocker at that moment but I feel today 
            I won't do the same mistake. For example, I had a mistake when 
            I tried to write a line for using Sort it said my list was an immutable
            list. For me, the word mutable wasn't relevant. Remember that my first 
            language is Spanish. I only could see that I had a mistake applying 
            Sort in my list. I thought that I missed adding something like a 
            library or something else because It was my first time using the collection 
            in my Java code.  Another situation was when I tried to send a class
            for a REST response but It said that my answer didn't meet the needs. I looked 
            for what could it be. After a time I discover I need to use setters and getters 
            in my class. In HyperSkill's theory, I learned that it's something I have to use 
            when I do an answer. 
          </p>
          <p>Finally, I finish my Cinema REST project. It was fun. In some parts, HyperSkill
            was a little confused about what the question meant to do. In some parts, we need 
            to search on the web for more information about a concept it wasn't clear. I had to
            search for how to change the "Error" in the ResponseEntity. Then, how to throw
            exceptions in Java. For this last one, I need to practice more or complement the idea
            because I used a condition but I feel this something helpful for the 
            next time. 
          </p>

         <h3 class="subtitle">Lightning-talks</h3>
         <p>This wwek was our last Lightning-talk. I decided to talk about Maven. It
            is a built tool for Java. When I start this program I did'n know about it. 
            When we did the ToDo app I had to learn how to use it because I need it to
            integrate my project, to run my app. 
         </p>
         <p>Something useful to know about maven:
         </p>
         <p>Problems that Maven Solved:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Getting right JAR files for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages. </li>
            <li>Visit mvnrepository.com to get dependencies (It's not necessary to make it manually)</li>
            <li>Helps to create the right project structure which is essential for execution. </li>
            <li>Building and deploying the project to make it work. (Manage building, documentation, releasing and distribution in project management.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lightning-talks were kind of difficult for me because I struggle to manage my
            nervousness. Always I have to practice before, and if something wrong happens
            I have problems trying to pretend because that makes me nervous. However, I think I 
            did a great job. Usually, people don't notice how nervous I'm. But 
            I know. At the end, my feedbackes were possitives. My first Lightning-talk
            I had some difficulties practicing because I felt nervous so I decided to see
            what happens. Like Hakuna Matata. Obviously, I had problems with some 
            mispronunciations and projecting my presentation. The second, I practice more and
            I feel it was my fevorite. Then, for the last, I had just 5 min to present.
            I think was a good one but It was a short time, I was a little rush at the end. 
            Anyway, It was a good presentation.
        </p>

        <p>This was one of my last comments: </p>
        <p>I like your icebreaker from the beginning, 
            it was a good example to provide context. 
            Your explanations were good and concise. 
            Your English pronunciation also improved a 
            lot. Congrats!</p>

            <p>I'm petty happy with my progress. It can see a better way to organize
                my code and a little more flow in my code. Next week, I'm going to 
                start the second project in HyperSkill and probably I'll 
                have another assignation before the year ends. 
        </p>
