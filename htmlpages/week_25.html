          <h6>This week was pretty relaxed because we didn't have an official assignment. I used this week to finish 
            some courses that I had pending. I did a course about SQL and another about algorithms. Also, I add details to my
            CV and I actualized my Protafolio. Finally, I dedicate time to my studies in the Frontend. I read
            some articles about how to choose typography for your website.
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Training Activities</h3>

        <p>I decided to do training activities this week. I'm glad for the time I have to learn something new. I chose
            to take a course about SQL and continuo the course about algorithms. Also, I study my schoolar programm that is 
            about CSS. This week we learned tips to select typography. Every time I learn something about frontend, 
            I feel it's the area that I want to specialize because it implies to have creativity and a sharp feel about what 
            you want to transmit. 
        </p>

        <p> I finished the SQL course. I could understand better how works some tools that I used in previous projects. 
            When I used spring boot, it has a dependency to manage data, JPA.  
        </p>

        <p>Also, I continued my course of algorithms....</p>

        <p>Like an extra, I updated my CV. I designed something different to manage whatever that will happend next, because my 
            training in this company is almost over. I feel it's important to have updated my Portfolio and my CV
            to reach opportunities that can come. I have enjoyed these months here and would like to stay, but I should be prepared
            to find something if this company doesn't have an opportunity for me. Also, I make time to practice what can come in an 
            interview, the skills I'll share, and what I have to improve to have a better chance. Around this program
            I have gain confidence in my skills but I feel still I have to improve more and also realice that I can do many 
            new and different things. 
        </p>

        <p>Finally, I want to share with you what I learned of how to choose typography for a website. I applied these new tools
            as I was building my new CV. I can tell it has a great view. I used 2 different typefaces. I designed the Page
        with two different colors. The size of my paragraph is small, so the information can fit, but it has space between 
    paragraphs and sections. I selected just the specific information that can show and call what I'm. The photo I selected
was from a professional section that I had on my birthday the last year, but the background in the photo combined with the selected
colors. In total, it's a pallet of three colors (text black, white, and turquoise background, a pink background in my photo)  </p>
