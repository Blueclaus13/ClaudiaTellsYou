          <h6>This week I'm going to talk what I have done with the open source projects I selected for 
             my stacks. I have a stack of Java and another one of React. 
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Open Source</h3>
            <p>This week has been full of activities to accomplish the open-source module. I selected a couple
                of projects; one is in Java and the other is in React. I have done some research to understand 
                what to do about the issue request. It hasn't been easy because some issues are more 
                complicated than I have of experience, and you can feel some pressure to resolve 
                something that you don't understand.
            </p>
            <p>My oldest project for open-sources is about Java. It's <a href="https://github.com/sirixdb/sirix">
                Sirix</a>. It's about serializing and deserializing some pages. Their logic is already done but they
             have a little disorganized the ubication of the serialization, so they are looking to set the 
            logic on the only file named Pagekind. It's not easy because this is a large project so I have to move 
            a lot of methods and check that they are still working. Right now, I'm looking to make a test/mock 
           to check if the code is working right.   </p>

           <p>When I start on this project I had trouble understanding what I need to do, so I start asking 
            people next to me what they understood of the issue's description. I thought 
            it could be that I have too naive to understand Java problems. Then, I realized that 
            I need to ask for more information from the owner of the issue. It was more about losing the fear of 
        asking something without sense. It might not be nonsense but I felt like that. Finally, I took brave and 
    I start sending a message by Discord chat. They were nice with me and answered all the questions I had about the code. 
         </p>
         <p>Currently, I'm working of cheking my code with the test they have on the project. 
         </p>

         <p>My second project for my stack is a small project that needs to change the style of the required field. 
            It sounds easy, and I think it's but I also had some issues with the communication. I used without 
            hesitate the Discord chat to contact the owner and ask some questions about what he wants to change of the
            style. 
         </p>
         <div><img src="../images/react pull Request/initial state.png" alt="initial state second pull request" 
            style="width: 50%;"></div>

            <p>The problem with the issue's description is that it isn't clear what kind of change he wants.
                My perception of modern can be different than his. I decided to ask him on Discord. First I did
                some changes and made him a proposal and then he asked me for something different. I haven't finished making his review changes, but you will find them in the technical log that I will write 
                 about this issue. Right now, I'm working on correcting his notes to make another pull request so that 
                  this time can be accepted. 
            </p>

            <p>That's all that I have for this week. I don't want to explain a lot what is in my issues because
                I want to make the large description in my technical log. 
            </p>

            <p>Next week, I'll have two technical logs to show you about the resolution of my issues. Also, 
                this week at the school I'm working on animation and transitions. I want to share here the
                side menu I'll do. 
            </p>
