          <h6>After finishing our Project we have a couple of days to fix life. I did a technical 
            log and study the algorithms course I want to finish before the interviews. Also, we received our
             next assignment; it's about open source. This is a new topic that I have searched for the last few days. 
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">My own study</h3>
       
        <p>I have a personal goal. I want to finish the Data structure course I bought in Udemy. 
            For the last few months, I couldn't continuo my course because I really didn't have enough time
            between my personal needs in life and the time consuming of the projects. This week I had time, 
            I decided to continuo my course. It has this topics:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrays</li>
            <li>Stacks</li>
            <li>Queues</li>
            <li>Linked List</li>
            <li>Hash Tables</li>
            <li>Trees</li>
            <li>Graphs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The only topic I could finish is the arrays. I already know and manage arrays in different
            programming languages (Java, python, JavaScript, Typescript). This course is focused 
            on teaching you about the Big O notation to understand how readable is my code, and how are time 
             and space complexity. So in some algoritmonts problems, I can select what kind of Data structure
              is the most convenient to solve the problem. 
        </p>

        <h4>Arrays</h4>

        <div><img src="../images/Master_the_Interview_Click_here_for_Course_Link_.png"
            alt="Array study" style="width: 100%;">
        <p>I did some approaches with arrays trying to solve problems where I need one or more arrays. </p>
        <p>I learned that you occupy double space when you try to append or push data in an array.
            This data structure has fast lookups, fast push or pop data, and ordered. 
        But it has slow inserts and slow deletes and it has a fixed size in JS. Well, depends 
     on the programming language and what practice functions have for an array. I remember
    that Java has practical data structure calls... it's another kind or array because it manages dynamic arrays.  </p>
    <p>I see arrays as useful when I have to collect short lines of data. If I search into the data I may need another one depending on how the sort is 
        or how large the list of data is. 
    </p>

          <h3 class="subtitle">Open Source Approaches </h3>
          <p>This is new topic. I'm pretty nervous about this assignment because when I look for an issue I can handle
            I realized some inconvenience to find one for me. The first is that I have to check if the repository
             is active. Then, check what kind of issues it has and if there isn't someone assigned. Also, check if the issue is opened, some
             repositories have issues that are pretty old and people have taken contributions but never given a pull request. In those 
             cases is pretty confusing to know if I can do the issue or not.
          </p>
           <p>I decided to leave some messages or comments in repositories to know if it's active. 
            I did a list of possible repositories where I can find
            activity and issues. Hopefully this Monday I can receive an answer, the other way I should ask for contributions from others. 
            The time is running, and I just have this week to give a pull request in a repository. 
           </p>
           <p>This week I read about Open source and I realized that some companies, like google chrome practices this.
            I imagine that this gives opportunity to work on real projects. I didn't know how easy was to find a free occupation.
            I'm impressed with the people that dedicate their time to fix problems in open source. 
            I hope I can do a great job in the projects in which I choose to participate. 
           </p>

           <p>The next week I will bring you news about how I'm doing in this new module. Hopefully, I have done two pull requests and 
            I can tell you how was my experience. 
           </p>
