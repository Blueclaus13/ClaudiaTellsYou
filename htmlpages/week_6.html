            <h4>Developing App's frontEnd</h4>
            <h6>In general, this week was about learning new things, again. I focused to watch Oreilly tutorial about React. 
                It helped me to build the appearance and the communication between my components. Also, I started the 
                backEnd project with a controller class that gave me a GET and a POST request with the correct service code.
            </h6>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Learning React</h3>
                <p>After I made and understood how I could send the data from my backEnd to my frontEnd. I decided to start 
                    building the appearance of my App. I watched some hours of Oreilly tutorial and I realized all the information there
                    was well-detailed. It helped me to understand how React works. 
                </p>
                <p>I used the flex style to set all my components on the view. I feel more confident with the flex commands but I 
                    like to use the Grill. Even though it's more organized, it can extend my CSS style because I have to Specific
                    the names of all elements. I only used a grill in the filter search component. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This week, I learned how to use the hook useState to collect the data in my components. Also, I used some
                    map functions to print dynamic code. I understood how to make a Model. I used it to ask for data to make a new To-do task. 
                    Righ now, I'm fixing a problem in my code because It breaks when I click summit. I'm learning how to debug in React. 
                </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Making a Service</h3>
            <p>I did my project in Intellij where I started to build some methods to Request data. 
                When this week started I had a lot of questions about how to ask for Data from backEnd to frontEnd, then 
                I resolved some of them by learning about how to build a microService. There I realized how to use Maven in my project.
                After, I did some methods and set the right code response.
            </p>
            <p>I used Postman as a tool to visualize the data sent and received with GET and POST. Before this week, 
                I didn't know this, so I should watch some tutorials to understand how to work with it.</p>
                

            <h3 class="subtitle">Summary</h3>
                <p>The whole week was too busy learning and putting into practice everything in my app. I feel tired. Also,
                    I'm excited because I could make big progress on the App's development. Some questions were resolved 
                    this week. Others only look clearer. 
                </p>
                <p> For the next week I have the expectation to start in my backEnd logic code.
                     I prefer to connect my Backend with my frontend with my microService. Then, I can start visualizing any 
                     result that I send from my Backend.</p>
