            This week I decided to get focoused in develop some logic code problems to practice JAVA and my
            programming logic. I want especially to gain experience knowing what Data structure tools to used 
            when I have a technical interview.

        <p>This week I decided to use all the concepts I learned in my data structure course and the Java course to
            solve some exercises in HakerRank. It is a cool website where you solve problems and earn points
            for each solution. I have to make algorithms it's really useful to understand when to use a map,
            a linked list, or an array for easier coding. Sometimes when I can't build something, 
            I realize it's because I lack a concept or because I get frustrated with my mental pressure. 
            I think it's really good this exercise to force myself to get focused and keep trying when something
             it's threatening. 
        </p>
    

           <p>This week I continued my course in basics in Java. I learned methods for String. I decided to make some 
            excercises from <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/string/index.php#editorr"> 100 exercises for Java Strings</a>
            I did some of them just to put into practice what I learned. I stopped at number 33 because it needed recursion. 
            I left that problem for the next week because I'm learning about Algorithms in my Data Structure course. I want to
            know the theory and then I'll use that exercise as a practice to think of a solution. 
            <br>
            This is the link for the word document where I'm saving my solutions for the problems that I'm resolving.
