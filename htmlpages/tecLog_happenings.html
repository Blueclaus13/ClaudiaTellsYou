          <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>What is happenings ? </h5>
          <p>Happenings was built with an idea of documenting your journey. 
            You can create a timeline and either keep it private to yourself 
            or generate a public url for you to showcase your achievments / journey.</p>

          <p>The next picture can show you the issue that I decided to participate.

            <p>I chose this issue because I got experience fixing problems
                in React with the apprentice app. I feel capable to help someone when they want an enhancement
                with the UX.

         <h3 class="subtitle">Solution</h3>
         <p>The first step is to set up the project on my local disk. I follow the instructions
            to set up the project but this repository is pretty new so it has instructions to set up a 
            google cloud where using supabase.com we can build a Database. I followed everything but 
            it was pretty confusing.
         </p>
         <p>When I start this issue I was confoused about what the owner needed. I decided to ask him 
             by Discord. Before I started a conversation, I decided to move the code a little to show him a 
             proposal of what I had on mind. I checked the library that he had used. This was ant design. 
             Before in other projects, I had used Material U, this library wasnt't too different from that.  
         </p>

         <div><img src="../images/react pull Request/first proposal.png" alt="first proposal"  style="width: 50%;"
            ></div>
         <p>My first proposal was to make the fields red when the user hasn't filled in them. When the modal opened
            the fields had to be red. Now, I think that isn't aesthetic but at that moment I only had in mind 
             to make it different than the red asterisk. Also, I add a help; if the user erased the field 
             a message under the input will tell "Please input a ___"
         </p>

         <div><img src="../images/react pull Request/messageHelp.png" alt="messageHelp" style="width: 50%;" 
            ></div>

            <p>I talked with the owner to give him this proposal, but he suggested something different. 
                He didn't like the red input boxes, he wanted to get ripped the asterisks, and 
                he wanted the under help in the inputs. 
            </p>
            <p>Then, I found another way to set required fields using tooltips on them</p>
            <div><img src="../images/react pull Request/tooltips.png" alt="UsingTooltips" style="width: 50%;" 
                ></div>
          
                <p>He liked more this idea and he asked if I could add a tooltip to the save button and make the 
                    button disabled unless those required fields were filled in. I did that, but it wasn't easy 
                    because of the library ant design. Then, I found a way to personalize the modal component from 
                    the library. 
                </p>

                <p>My first pull request on this project:</p>
                <div style="display: flex; width:100vh; flex-flow: row wrap">
                    <img src="../images/react pull Request/buttontooltip.png" alt="ButtonTooltips" style="width: 40%;" >
                    <img src="../images/react pull Request/block button until all fields fiil in.png" alt="button block" 
                    style="width: 40%;" >
                    <img src="../images/react pull Request/first tried.png" alt="first tried" 
                    style="width: 40%;" >
                    </div>
                

                <p>I received some corrections in the revision of my code. I did some mistakes in keeping the 
                    style of the code: for example; I used a function with a Spanish name, I didn't use comments 
                    to explain my code and I left unnecessary code of my trieds. 
                </p>

                <p>I think that happened because it was night when I did my pull request so I did it fast without check the 
                  rest of the edited file. 
                </p>

                <p>Finally, I corrected the complete pull request and I summited the changes</p>

                <p>Also, he asked me to change the tooltip that was next to the blocked save button. I change this to have
                  the tooltip when the user set the cursor over the button. 
                </p>

                <div><img src="../images/react pull Request/Screen Shot 2023-03-03 at 15.18.43.png" alt="initial state second pull request" 
                  style="width: 50%;"></div>

                <p>The final result is the modal with the tooltips in the required inputs and the "saved" button blocked 
                  if the required inputs aren't filled in. Also, when the user fills in the input but for any reason they 
                  erased it, a red commend asking to fill it will appear under the required input. 
                </p>

                <p>Currently, I'm waiting to receive an approved request for this issue. </p>
