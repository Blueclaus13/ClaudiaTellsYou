            This was an interesting week because I could finish important topics. I finished the project using 
            Redux-toolkit in React. I saw the differences between this way to use Redux and the old named Redux-core. 
            Also, I practiced functions Asynchronous to call data from a Database, in this case, I used Firebase. I tried to 
             build my own service with a SQL database, but I had some difficulties managing Database programs. Finally, I studied
             Java language to make some applications of the theory and Data structure course that I have taken.

           <p>This week I continued my course in basics in Java. I learned methods for String. I decided to make some 
            excercises from <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/string/index.php#editorr"> 100 exercises for Java Strings</a>
            I did some of them just to put into practice what I learned. I stopped at number 33 because it needed recursion. 
            I left that problem for the next week because I'm learning about Algorithms in my Data Structure course. I want to
            know the theory and then I'll use that exercise as a practice to think of a solution. 
            <br>
            This is the link for the word document where I'm saving my solutions for the problems that I'm resolving.

            <p>I finished my project on React to learn API requests and Redux. In the last project of
                ApprenticeUniverse, I used redux-core to store the data between my components. I learned at that moment that sometimes when the app
                starts the data is empty and we need to make sure that doesn't brake our deployment of components. Now, with this small 
                project of practice, I learned that Redux core is updated in Redux toolkit. This is recommended because configured Redux-core is more
                complicated. It has an approach to simplify the application's code. <a href="https://github.com/Blueclaus13/01-starting-project">Start Project React-Redux</a>

                <p style="background-color: pink;">Pausing development of SERVICE</p>

             <p>I decided to pause my project to make a service because I feel I need to fix some problems with the Database connection.
                I see that the connection is made, but when I did the code to make a table, an error came. <br>
                React project is made to save the Cart of my e-commerce app, but, I want my service to have all the logic of the program.
                Because the React project is just to practice API requests and Redux, I feel I should redesign the service to have models of
                products, receipts, returns, and sales. I want to make dad for a complited project. I first I'm gaining the tools
                to make my frontEnd with React and then I'll continue with my service. <br>
                To accomplish that goal, I'm learning Java full Stack so I can see how I'm going to integrate my Data base. While I'm doing it,
                I'll continue with my React tools. 
            </p>

            
            <p style="background-color: pink;">What is comming...</p>

            <p>For next week, I'm planing to send you some excercises where I'm using Data structure in Algorithms. My
                Data structure course has given me really good knowlegde to put in practice. Then, this week (2nd May- 5th May), 
                I'm taking practice with some code interview questions where I should apply Data structure to resolve the 
                logic. In my next report, I'll explaint how I resolved some problems.
