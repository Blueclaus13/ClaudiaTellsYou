            This week we presented the hands-off of our project. It means that is the final demonstration
 that we have to do for our clients. Also, we delivered the Documentation. This last project 
 was as crazy as you could read in the last weeks. However, it brought me the impression that 
 I did things that I thought I couldn't do it. We missed some requirements like the notifications.
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Results</h3>
         <p> If you are interesting, you can read the Technical Log in this link: 
            <a href="htmlpages/tecLog_ApprenticeUniverse.html">Technical Log Apprentice Universe App</a> 
            This is a large explanation about the final result in the project.</p>

         <p>This section I want to focouse more in the challange and what it brought to me</p>

         <p>When we started this project my team was pretty confident to reach all the 
            requirements. In my case, I was afraid about the time. It was just a month and 
            the requirements like security, logging, and tables relationship between models. All of those topics 
            were new to me. I know I could do it but in a month? presenting every week something ? It sounds 
            crazy to me. 
         </p>
         <p>The first expectation that you have about a hard Homework is fear. Something that help 
            me a lot in this project was that I wasn't the only one experimenting that feeling.
          We were on the same boat. That is one of the things that I'm proud on this project
        how my team and I traied to resolve something when someone was having a difficult moment. Supporting
    each other.  </p>

        <p>I have to tell you that we didn't deliver all the requirements. The client asked for 
            notifications and a backload pretty different than they wrote in the documentation. Well, the 
            client dind;t tell us nothing about the backload, I suppos they didn't care about the changes.
            Anyway, the notifications were something that we missed. We didn't have enough time to connect what 
 we had with the project. Because it still needed adjustments, we decided to leave notifications out of the 
 delivery.
        </p>

        <p>Why that happened? I think, we thought that when we put the pieces together it wouldn't be
            a problem. That is a mistake. I can say that I knew it before. I belive it is the deadline's project
        </p>
       <p> The project had a too short deadline. This was a big application, the requirements were 3 kind of roles
        security, notifications , responsive design and 10 different kind of models related between. Our team was ready
         for this app, for sure, but when you are new on a team and you don't know their skills
        how can you plan where they will go ? all of us learned in big steps for this project. No one was an 
    expert in any area. Also, this was our first time making an app with a team. We had just one week to make research
about situations that we supposted that we would had.  I won't say it's impossible don't have mistakes, 
   but it was a high likelihood. Without a good planification that happends.  </p>

   <p>Also a solid plan makes the confidence in the team. When you have a solid plan the team knows where to go 
     because you predicted the problems and you made strategic solutions on paper. If someone has a problem
     they can go to check the documentation to find answers. That doesn't mean that won't be problems but 
      it reduces the uncertainty and the team works better. 
   </p>

   <p>That is the main reason I can tell you that the failure for the missing parts is because 
    we need a better strategy to do this project together. 
   </p>

   <p>What is the strategic?</p>
   <p>First, I would focus my project on developing diagrams of the backend and the frontend. If I have diagrams 
    I can follow a structure to make my code. I would do a prevention plan with all the possible 
    situations that I can have around the project in my code and for my team. Then, I will add a section of
    tools for building my app. Before we have complete and great documentation and modulation of the project
    we can't start because I have to be sure that all my team knows what to do. It means that my team already take
    responsibility for something in the app and they researched thinking about their parts. (in this app we weren't sure what 
    to search because we tried to reach everything). Then, we should have deadlines but they should be with extra time.
    For example, if we have 15th days per deadline, we should finish with 4 or 3 days before to set things together. 
    but with one week's deadline, you don't have time for that. Also, the deadline for starting the project should be
    shorter than the last demonstration. If you see time as a cake; divide into 8 parts,
    It's like 2 parts of the time to start, 4 parts developing, and the other two parts 
    in the last section. 
   </p>

   <p>That is my dream strategy haha. I know this project is to prepare us better for the future and I appreciate I just feel it was too hard haha.
   </p>

   <p>Also, we have situations in my team because we weren't working at the same rhythm. For different reasons,
     some personal situations, school, unresponsability ect. That is another difficilt part working with a team that 
     doesn't have the same rhythm. In some parts you feel too much stress because you can't reach the Weekly goals.
     Moreover, that happened because this was an extensive project that requires more time to set a more healthy times to work on it.
   </p>

   <p>In the end, we received acceptance for our project but those details that I mentioned made it the most 
    challenging project that I have done. I think we did the best that we could do and for sure we are better prepared 
    for a situation like that. I'm glad with the result that we delivery because it was done with too much efford
     from everyone to deliver something with quality.
