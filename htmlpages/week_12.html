          <h6>This week we work in our last Lightning-talk and I finished my first project 
            in HyperSkill. The project was the Cinema REST using Spring and new configurations
            that I learned. My Lightning-talk was about Mavel. It was a cool presentation. I am 
            happy because I finished a project in HyperSkill. 
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">HyperSkills</h3>
          <p>All this week I had been working on the Cinema REST project for the last 
            4 weeks. It was a large process because I had too much theory to learn. 
            I have to review it again to practice for interviews later. I felt this program
            is developing new and helpful abilities. In the stages of HyperSkill's project
            I didn't need too much help to understand what I need it to do. I only had an internal
            error so in the REST answer was a 500 error that I took some time to fix it. 
          </p>
          <p> In the app ToDo I had some mistakes that I can understand today Why
            that code was wrong. Those were a blocker at that moment but I feel today 
            I won't do the same mistake. For example, I had a mistake when 
            I tried to write a line for using Sort it said my list was an immutable
            list. For me, the word mutable wasn't relevant. Remember that my first 
            language is Spanish. I only could see that I had a mistake applying 
            Sort in my list. I thought that I missed adding something like a 
            library or something else because It was my first time using the collection 
            in my Java code.  Another situation was when I tried to send a class
            for a REST response but It said that my answer didn't meet the needs. I looked 
            for what could it be. After a time I discover I need to use setters and getters 
            in my class. In HyperSkill's theory, I learned that it's something I have to use 
            when I do an answer. 
          </p>
          <p>Finally, I finish my Cinema REST project. It was fun. In some parts, HyperSkill
            was a little confused about what the question meant to do. In some parts, we need 
            to search on the web for more information about a concept it wasn't clear. I had to
            search for how to change the "Error" in the ResponseEntity. Then, how to throw
            exceptions in Java. For this last one, I need to practice more or complement the idea
            because I used a condition but I feel this something helpful for the 
            next time. 
          </p>
