          <h6>This week we were just focused in HyperSkill and our Lightning-talk. 
            I really learned new things developing the Cinema REST project. I would
            have liked to do HyperSkill before the To-Do App. I complemented my 
            understanding of Spring, abstraction, and some features of Java.
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">HyperSkills</h3>
          <p>All this week I have been working on the Cinema REST project.
            It has some differences from the To-Do App but I feel it complimented
            my understanding. There were some details of Java Languages that I applied 
            but I didn't know the reason why it was like that. For example, Why 
            does Java double and Double? Now I know that Java manages some primitive 
            values and a wrapper Class. 
          </p>
          <p>Something that I like form this opportunity is the capability
            to understand details what I couldn't understand before. In HyperSkill
            I did some exercises of Inheritance using polymorphism, super(),
            and interfases. There I revalue some concepts like: how to call 
            the Object when I do an instance from a Class? it's a reference type.
            Also, I couldn't comprise the function of the interface, but now I get it. I'm still confused 
            about when to use interface or polymorphism or another type of Inheritance.
            I think with some exercises and experience I'll get better at the concepts. 
          </p>
          <p>I would like to share a paragraph from a section in the project 
            where they gave some recomendations to manage the bugs in Code.</p>

        <p>
            <i>
                As you see, you don't have to be alone with your code 
                that won't work for whatever reason: there are many great 
                sources out there that can help. If you wonder how to handle 
                exceptions in Java, try StackOverflow, but “how do I reverse a 
                linked list” is a good question for GeeksForGeeks. The last 
                fundamental advice is this: use your brain and don't panic. 
                Finding and correcting your errors might be frustrating, 
                but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier and starts 
                seeming more like a routine than a catastrophe.

            </i>
        </p>

        <p>Many times in To-Do App I got stuck from bugs in my code or situations
            I couldn't understand without help. I know I'm learning new things and 
            can be frustrating but It's good to know that it's normal 
            to feel like that when you start programming.
        </p>
        <p>Talking about bugs, I also want to share some recommendations to 
            reduce the number of bugs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding the requirements of the program</li>
                <li>Following the standards of the language</li>
                <li>Building a clear-cut architecture of the program</li>
                <li>Checking the program with boundary values</li>  
                <li>Using automated tests</li>
            </ul>
        <p>I'm still learning how to make a test. I think all these recommendations
            are perfect to check when I found a problem in my code. 
        </p>

         <h3 class="subtitle">Lightning-talks</h3>
         <p>This week I prepared my second Lightning-talk. I chose SOLID principles
            because this was a topic someone told me to check while I was writing 
            my BackEnd for the ToDo app. 
            </p>
            <p>Solid is a set of rules and best practices to follow while 
                designing a class structure. These five principles help us 
                understand the need for certain design patterns and software 
                architecture in general. 
                So I believe that it's a topic that every developer should learn.</p>

            <p>Next, I want to tell you the 5 principles: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Single Responsibility Principle</li>
                <li>The Open-Closed Principle</li>
                <li>The Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
                <li>The Interface Segregation Principle</li>
                <li>The Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I felt I did a better job in this presentation beacuse I was a little
                less nervious. I think my worst enemy are my feelings 
                 when I'm nervious. I hope the next presentation I feel it more 
                  natural. 
            </p>
