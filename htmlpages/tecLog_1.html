          <h6>This technical log it's about my own personal problem of CodeJam.
            I decided to build a python code of Double or One Thing. When I started I was
            a little lost about how to break the problem. I checked the analysis to figout out 
            what to do. I did 3 different tries one better than the next one. In the end,  
            I built a code with efficency from O(n^2) to O(n).

          </p>
          <p>You are given a string of uppercase English letters. You can highlight any number of the letters (possibly all or none of them). The highlighted letters do not need to be consecutive.
              Then, a new string is produced by processing the letters from left to right: non-highlighted letters are appended once to the new string, while highlighted letters are appended twice.
          </p>
          <div><img src="../images/DorOTexplication.png" alt="image to explaint the problem"></div>
          <p>Given a string, there are multiple strings that can be obtained as a result of
             this process, depending on the highlighting choices. Among all of those strings, output the one that appears first in alphabetical (also known as lexicographical) order.

        <p>The solution here is the result of two more tries. It took me some time to
           understand the problem and then when I did my first code wasn't completely right.
          My first approach was to make all the possible solutions and loop
          in them to select the one with alphabetic order. This program run well
          with short words but with larger words it was stuck. 
        </p>
        <div><img src="../images/Possible solutions.png" alt="sample's solutions"></div>
        <p>Then, my second approach was better. It could do half of the solutions but I missed
          a pattern. We're taking this example --> AABBA. I missed this fact: when we
          have a group of words (same letter) next to a higher in alphabetical order letter,
          the group of letters could double but when the group was next to a lower it is supposed to stay
          in one. My mistake was that my code was checked letter by letter. It means that in a group
           of letters BBA my result was BBBA because I duplicate the first B because it was the same letter. The right result is BBA stays like that because B is bigger than A
           Then, when my code fails Codejame. I realized the fact that I need to do a comparison
           by groups of letters and duplicate by groups.
        </p>
        <p>When I found that pattern I did the last solution and I improved the efficiency because I started
          to understand how Efficiency works. I had a nested for to loop and make the comparations by letter. I 
          decided to build a class where I can save the letters and a counter to track by groups. 
          Then I just built a Foor to loop in a list and I nested a condition to control the index when it reached
          the edge of the list. I based the code in 3 main conditions:
        </p>
        <p>Result should be in alphabetic order example inputs AAB ; BBA ; AAA</p>
        <ul>
         <li>1-If the letter is smaller than the next letter, it should double
          the letter( or group of letters): result AAAAB </li>
         <li>2 -If the letter is  bigger than the next letter, it 
          doesn't double the letter( or group of letters): result BBA</li>
          <li>3-If the string that we receive contains the same group of letters,
            it should result the same string: result AAA</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Talking about the alternatives solutions</h3>
        <p>My tries in this code show me how many ways can exist to build a program. 
          Also, the result code depends on how well you understand the needs. For me, it was 
           one of the more difficult parts. I fix that, by reading about the analysis of the problem, 
           looking at some videos explaining the dynamic movement of the variables, and building some Treemaps
           to understand the algorithm patterns. 
        </p>
        <p>I think there are more solutions to rich this problem. I made one of them with good efficiency.
          I think something I can improve is the organization of my code, the name of my variables.
           Well, in this blog my code looks badly organized but in my python file, 
           it has comments and good indent. 
          I can conclude that the best approach it's the code understandable and efficient in run time. </p>
