            <h4>Developing App's BackEnd Part 2</h4>
            <h6>This week I had a lot of blockers. I got sick on Monday with a fever and the rest of the 
                week was difficult working. I worked in my backend with all the GETs, POSTs, and PUTs. 
                I spent my time watching tutorials when I felt too bad about coding. I applied all my
                patient to feel better with the discomfort of my limitations 
                to understand how to sort or make the pagination and the filters. 
            </h6>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Learning Java and Request</h3>
                <p>Around this week I decided to continou Oreilly's tutorial about Java. 
                    There I learned about the list methods I could use to manage data. 
                    It was something simple but I didn't feel well to do more. 
                </p>
                
                <p> I could build the Put and Post methods where I could edit data in my app throug the 
                    BackEnd. I also ask for help with the sort because I couldn't build the method whit 
                    the tools I was using. I found a CompareTo and collection lybraries. I could use
                    them to make a sort with the data.  
                </p>
                <p>On youtube, I research how to ask for parameters by request. I learned that I have to ask for parameters to know what page, 
                    kind of sort, and filter the client is asking. It's something difficult to understand new features of 
                spring because if I have something wrong I have problems identifying what it is.  </p>
               
               
                <a id="topbutton" href="#top">Back to the Top </a>
    
                

            <h3 class="subtitle">Summary</h3>
            <p>I feel I almost finish this app, there are just details to build. I have an idea about how 
                to make the rest of my application. This week I'll connect the backend and the frontend. 
                I have to finish the metrics in the backend. 
               </p>
               <p>I feel week 8 was the loosest week I have had. Whit the flue and my 
                   limitations to understand how to fix the blockers in my backend App. I think
                   I feel like that because I'm having problems making debugs through spring and some
                   deficient in Java programming.
