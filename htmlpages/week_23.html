          <h6>This week has been difficult to continue the open source. I had some blockers like family, code, and test issues. I did a pull request in a repository that uses react and javascript. Also,
            I continued the issue where I have to serialize and deserialized pages, there is where I have big blockers
            in the code. 
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Open Source</h3>

          <p>The last week told you that I'm working on an issue to serialize and deserialized some pages from a database.
            This week I finally finished the changes but I have to figure out what is the problem with the tests. 
            I have run the project's test but they show errors. I debugged the program and I have a small idea about 
             where is it, but I have a blocker on it. I think the problem is that I didn't serialize well one of the pages. 
             I compared a test that run without problems and the project where I have the situation. I did that because 
             the issue isn't marked on the code that I changed but I think in some way my code was affected there. 
          </p>  
          <p>Hopefully I can received test from people that has more experience in java, so I can go over this blocker soon 
            because this would be my second week with this issue and we only have another to finish this module. 
          </p>

          <p>My second issue was made in a repository that I didn't confirm to check with the staff. I received a soon answer
            from the owner so I decided to work on it the last weekend. I hope it can count but in some cases, I will make an effort to
            find a couple of issues this weekend to give another pull request if the last pull request doesn't count.

          <p>At the school this week I  did a sidemenu using only HTML and CSS. I really had fun with this experience 
             because I was interested to learn it without a library. I want to show you a photo of my result.
             You can access by this <a href="./SchoolWork/sidebarV2.html"> Sidemenu Link</a> or here I give you a photo:

            <p>I may use the next technical log with this sidemenu. </p>
