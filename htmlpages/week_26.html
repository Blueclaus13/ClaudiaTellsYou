          <h6>In general, this week consisted in prepare me for an opportunity. I have taken some 
            courses, some theory and reading. I continued with the Data structure course, a React course, and the mock 
            interview in the Hub.

       <p>These days I have waited for a new opportunity, like an interview. I want to have fresh knowledge of 
             Data structure, so I'm continuing my course in Undemy. I liked it because using JS I have some exercise
            that made me stretch my mind to think about how can I fix or resolve that code puzzle using Data structure. 
            I decided to build a library where you can see my exercise. I have practiced what is a Hash Map, and how can I use it for 
            interview questions. Right now, I'm working on Linked lists. Python and Java have them but JS don't, you have to build it, 
            so I'm working on how to build a class that can have the features of a Linked list. I think it helps me to understand the 
            logic of this tool. That helps to know when to use it. <a href="https://replit.com/@ClaudiaDe8/NearTornCareware#index.js"> library
                in Reply for code in courses
            </a> </p>

        <p>Also, I decided to complement my knowledge of React. There was a course from our training 
            in the To-Do App. That course I took it but it was 47 hours long. I did part of it until the chapter 
            15. I'm in Chapter 16 learning about Redux in react. I used redux in the Apprentice App that we did
            in a past module. I got interested in finishing the React course because I see the ahead chapters talk about 
            the tools I used for the apprentice App. There are things that I would like to see if I could do better
            than I did. Here you can find an app that I built to practice the interview task from The hub <a href="https://github.com/Blueclaus13/search-app">Project in React for mock interview</a>
        </p>

        <p>Finally, in addition to the courses that I'm following. I found another helpful resource. I'm just watching
            a YouTuber that did a REST with Node.js Those videos help me to understand what packets I need from npm 
            if I want to build a backend with Node. 
            <a href="https://app.codigoencasa.com/courses/node-version-light/VcAG8lDH">Node courses</a>. Also in Undemy
            I bought a course in Java because I'm interested to check what a full course in Java can contain. This 
            I haven't started it but hopefully the next week I'll finish one of the courses I'm taking or I'll have
            already an interview programmer.
