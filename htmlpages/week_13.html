          <h6>This week was to build our Resume and to continuo with HyperSkill. 
            Around this days I had a blocker to finish the stage 3/5 in HyperSkill. 
            Also, the application fail for a whole day because Jet brain had some
            problems to run the projects.I have been watching recommendations to make an 
             developer interview.  
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">HyperSkills</h3>
          <p>This week was kind of frustrating in HyperSkill. The project that I'm 
            working on is Code-Sharing-Platform. It's an app to share code where I'll 
            learn about databases. I'm really interested in Database topics because I 
            don't know anything about them. It was disappointing to have the blocker
            run the program because of an Error from Jetbrain in the configuration. It 
            cost an entire day to fix it. Then, after I run my project, it had some
            errors that I fixed. However, the stage didn't want to pass because 
            this application has a specific solution, template, or something that marks 
            wrong my code when it does the comparison. But if you shake the results in the 
            Postman, you can see there's not difference in my outcoming with the examples. 
          </p>
          <p>I could see hyperkills had some configuration problems. Sometimes the error is 
            more from Jetbrain than yours. It's difficult to have a service assistant when you
            find something unusual. The main idea about a training app in development it's 
            really interesting. I think it's good, it has potential. But to improve, they need 
            to pay more attention to the assistance. 
          </p>
          <p>Something that I learned from this situation is the many ways to make a sort 
            in a list. One of my problems was that I was changing my entire list instead
            to make a copy and then change the collected data. In other words, how to make
            sort in an immutable list. Someting that worked for me was: <br>
            <code>List newList = new ArrayList(unmodifiableList);</code><br>
          </p>
          <p>This blocker took me almost 2 days to fix. It was a combination of Jetbrain
            fault and my own. 
          </p>

         <h3 class="subtitle">Resume and interview's preparetion</h3>
         <p>All this program has the purpose to let me a job with an Encora's client. Then, 
            it's important to actualize my Resume for any moment when I need to sell 
            myself. I have been watching recommendations to answer interview problems, questions,
            and situations that I can face. 
         </p>
         <p>One of the things I have worked it's the answer to my strengths and weakness. 
            I did an online test to check what kind of personality I have. It also says
            what is my weakness. Usually, I know about my strengths but I have problems seeing
            my weaknesses. It's not because I don't have them. It's because I can't avoid
            feeling bad when I talk about the things I don't like about myself. I'm afraid 
            to look vulnerable when I am supposed to show reasons to be hired. Then I realize
            it's not complicated at all. This exercise brought me a better way to see this interview's questions. It's not about showing my weakness, it's about showing
            how I'm overcoming it. I see my weakness it's to appear cold or detached to some people.
            It's because sometimes I prioritize reasons over feelings. Although,
            I feel I show deep affection, my family says that I can be a little cold. 
            It's how I'm and I don't feel I have to change, but I think I can demonstrate 
            to other people how I'm and make them feel warm. I should work more on my 
            empathic side to show my appreciation and enhance others' qualities more often
