        <h1 class="subtitle">OVERVIEW</h1>
        <h6>This technical log is about the development of my ToDo Application.
          The functionality of this app is to add, delete, edit and control ToDo objects. The App
          is built with Java, Maven, Spring, React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS technologies. This was a project
          with a month's due date. In that period I had to develop an understanding of Java, Maven, Spring, and React
          because this was my first time making a complete app with those technologies. I received tutorial and
          reference information. I use websites, youtube, and Oreally tutorials for many concepts. 
          </h6>
         
        <h1 class="subtitle">CONTEXT</h1>
          <p>This context is divided in three main sections; Functional Requirements, Technical Requirements, and
              Engineering Requirements. Next I'm going to break down a short explication of the requirements in this app.  </p>
              <h5>Functional Requirements</h5>
                      <p>client needs to implement a to do list 
                        to help manage their tasks in their daily job.
                        The client asked you to implement the following functionality:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Create a “to do” specifying the name, a priority, and possibly a due date </li>
                <li>Ability to edit name, priority and due date for existing “to do” tasks 
                    <i>They want to be able to specify a due date or clear the due date 
                      (because they are not interested in when to finish that “to do”) </i></li>
                <li>Be able to filter “to do” specifying 
                   the name (or part of the name), and the priority, and if they are done/undone. </li>
                <li>Be able to sort the “to do” by priority and/or due date.  
                   <i>For example, be able to sort items where their due date is 
                    soon and sort them also by priority to see what 
                    tasks are more urgent or less urgent </i></li>

                <li>Mark “to do” as done (clicking in a checkbox) or to undone a “to do” 
                    <i>The undone functionality is just there if there is a mistake.</i></li>
                <li>Since it is possible that the client will have a lot of “to do” 
                  they need to paginate the list of “to do”</li>
                <li>Ability to know, in average, the time between creation and done
                   for all “to do”. This should be shown in general for all done “to do” and also grouped by priority.
                    <i>This is important for the client since this is a metric, they follow to measure performance.</i> </li>
              </ol>
              <a id="topbutton" href="#top">Back to the Top </a>
              <h5>Technical Requirements</h5>
                      <p>The UI Requirements are specified for the the client as the following markup
                        to design the app.
                      </p>
                      <div><img src="../images/Technical Requirments.png"
                         alt="Specific Technical Requirements Markup" style="width: 50%;"></div>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Search/Filtering Controls </li>
                        <li>New To Do Button. This should open a modal to type the “to do” data.</li>
                        <li>Priority column should show in the header the classic up and down arrows to allow the user to sort </li>
                        <li>Due date column should show in the header the classic up and own arrows to allow the user to sort </li>
                        <li>Action column to show actions (links/buttons) to allow the user to delete or edit a “to do” 
                              <i>a. To Edit is ok to show a modal similar to the one to create a “to do” </i>
                        </li>
                        <li>Pagination control. Showing the pages, its number and the next and previous page is enough. </li>
                        <li>Area to show the metrics </li>
                      </ol>
                      <h6> Extra details you can add:</h6>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Show the row with background colors depending on the due date:
                                <br>
                                <ul><li>No due date --> No background color</li>
                                  <li>One week between due date and today --> Red background color </li>
                                  <li>2 weeks between due date and today --> Yellow background color </li> 
                                  <li>More that 2 weeks between due date and today --> Green background color </li> </ul></li>
                            <li>Strikethrough fonts for those tasks marked as done </li>
                          </ol>
              <a id="topbutton" href="#top">Back to the Top </a>
              <h5>Engineering Requirements</h5>
                  <p>The Engineering team of the client 
                    is asking you to implement the functionality using the following recommendations: </p>
                  
                  <p style="background-color: pink;">Model</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Id. This could be a number or string or a combination. Must be unique. </li>
                    <li>Text (required). Max length is 120 chars. </li>
                    <li>A due date (optional). </li>
                    <li>Done/undone flag </li>
                    <li>A done date. When the “to do” is marked as done this date is set</li>
                    <li>Priority (required). Options: High, Medium and Low. </li>
                    <li>Creation date.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style="background-color: pink;">API</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A GET endpoint (/todos) to list “to dos” 
                      <ul>
                        <li>Include pagination. Pages should be of 10 elements. </li>
                        <li>Sort by priority and/or due date </li>
                        <li>Filter by done/undone </li>
                        <li>Filter by the name or part of the name </li>
                        <li>Filter by priority </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A POST endpoint (/todos) to create “to dos”<br>
                        <i>Validations included </i> </li>
                    <li>A PUT endpoint (/todos/{id}) to update the “to do” name, due date and/or priority
                      <br>
                        <i>Validations included </i> </li>
                    <li>A PUT/POST endpoint (/todos/{id}/done) to mark “to do” as done
                      <ul><li>This should update the “done date” property </li>
                        <li>If “to do” is already done nothing should happen (no error returned) </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A PUT/POST endpoint (/todos/{id}/undone) to mark “to do” as undone 
                        <ul><li>If “to do” is already undone nothing should happen </li>
                            <li>If “to do” is done, this should clear the done date </li></ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
        <p style="background-color: pink;">Database</p>  
              <p>No need to use a database by now, storing data could be in
                 memory using Java Collections (no in-memory databases like H2) 
                 and it is ok if data is lost when the application is shutdown. 
                 But they are asking you to design the persistent layer such that
                  it will be somehow easy to switch from in-memory implementation 
                  to a database implementation (they are planning to implement the 
                  database implementation later). </p>

          <p style="background-color: pink;">Repositories</p>
                <p>They need 2 git repositories. Front end and back end.  
                  In both repositories the main branch must be the one ready for production. 
                  It's up to you the other branches. </p>
            <h6> Frontend Technology</h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript </li>
                    <li>ReactJS </li>
                    <li>Up to you to use Redux or React Context</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>They need at least the following commands to run the project:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>npm run start -> To run the front-end application</li>
                    <li>npm run tests -> To run all tests in the front-end application</li>
                  </ul>
            <h6> Backend Technology</h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Java </li>
                    <li>Maven</li>
                    <li>Spring Boot</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>They need at least the following commands to run the project:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>mvn spring-boot:run ->To run the back-end application </li>
                    <li>nvn test -> To run all tests in the back-end application </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Back-end project must run in port 9090. </p>
                    <p>Your API should handle correct http return codes: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Successful/Normal responses should return 200 (OK)</li>
                    <li>Responses where a resource is not found (saying if you are trying to get a specific resource or deleting one that no longer exists) should return 404 (Not Found) 
                      When a ToDo is created, it should return 201 (Created) </li>
                    <li>Validation errors when creating a ToDo should return 400 (Bad Request)
                       and their respective error message indicating what happened (stylistic Json format). </li></ul>
