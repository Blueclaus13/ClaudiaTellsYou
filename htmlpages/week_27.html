          <h6>In general, this week consisted in prepare me for an opportunity. I have taken some 
            courses, some theory and reading. I continued with the Data structure course, a React course, and Java theory. Also
            I did som excercises in SQL to practices the course that I took. 
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Training Activities</h3>
        <p>These days, I decided to continue my courses and make my own projects to practice 
            Whatever I have watched. First I started with te course or Data structure. This week I learned about the 
            Linked list, Stacks, and Queues. It's really useful to know how they work through building them in JS.
            <a href="https://replit.com/@ClaudiaDe8/NearTornCareware#index.js">Repository</a>. I feel this course helped
            to increase my analysis of a problem. How to resolve something with Data structure. </p>
            <p>Something that is related is my course in Java. I decided to practice also /java because I realized
                that this is a language that I should dominate if I want a job. The developing environment is full or offers
                in this area. I added the theory of programming that I should keep in mine they are questions
                for interview. I do the same with JS because with react, I need to know some theory of how 
                JS works as a Dynamic programing language. 
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I'm making some projects in React to practice Redux, APIs, and Database connexions in the front end. 
                I have thought that I should do my own website for my own business. It'll give me another incoming 
                while I'm looking for a position as a Developer. To add something, I have installed Msql to practice SQL 
                in clase I make a project with Java. 
            </p>
