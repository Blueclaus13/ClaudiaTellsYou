          <h6>After we did the Todo App we had a week of calmer. It's more about 
            training and learning. On thursday I had my first Lightning-talk. Around the 
            week I have been working in Hyperskill to develop a project named
             Cinema Room REST Service. 
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">HyperSkill</h3>
          <p>This week I strated with Hyperskill. Before, I had done some parts of
            the Cinema Project. Because I had a blocker with my subscription I cound't 
            continue. When the staff fixed the problem I was too involved with the ToDo 
            application, so I couldn't make big changes in what I had done.
          </p>
          <p>The course it's fun but at the same time, it's slow. I have to read too much.
            I like reading, but sometimes my eyes feel irritated. I have a tool in 
            Google chrome, to read the text on a website. It has been so helpful. 
          </p>
          <p>The take away I have made this week are few details in the theory for Java.
            I'm going to mention some of them; One is the scanning instance to get data 
            from the terminal when the program is running. I knew it beffore but I didn't 
            know how to use it into while/for/doWhile.  
          </p>
          <p>I learned some concepts; the difference between attribute and parameter. 
            It helps to define better when I talk about coding. Also, I learned what
            defined a type of data in Java. "Characters, long or int, Double or float". 
            In my app TODO I used Long but just because I knew it was for large numbers. 
            Now I know one difference between int and Long is the bytes they can save. 
          </p>

          <p>Other cool concept were some character we can use in the code </p>
          <ul>
            <li>'\n'is the newline character</li>
            <li>'\t'is the tab character</li>
            <li>'\r'is the carriage return character </li>
            <li>'\\'is the backslash character itself</li>
            <li>'\''is the single quote mark</li>
            <li>'\"'is the double quote mark</li>
            <li>“\d+” is a character class it matches digits [0-9],
                 and the + matches one or more occurrences of the character before.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I see the last one helpful to make a control-input
             for numbers.</p>
          

         <h3 class="subtitle">Lightning-talks</h3>
         <p>This week the lightning-talks started. They are some talks about a topic
            that the exponent chooses. The intention is to develop our speaker skills 
            and to have good management of the audience. 
            </p>

            <p> I prepared my content about 
                Spring Boot technology. It was a topic I chose because I had some questions
                about how I would connect all the classes in the App. I took Some time
                 to understand how to use it and why this was a good option for my app. It
                 was a technology completely new to me. </p>

            <p> I felt it was a good presentation but I need to improve some mispronunciations
                and dominate my nervous when something goes differently than the practice. 
            </p>
