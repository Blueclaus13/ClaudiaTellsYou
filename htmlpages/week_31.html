            Finally this week I received interviews to check the results of my preparation. 
            I have two interviews in Automation Testing area. I received feedback from both with good observation points 
             to improve my skills. I'm very pleasure with the result of my interviews. 
          </h6>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Training Activities</h1>

        <p>This week was the moment to prove my efforts in studying Java, Data structure, and React. I received 
            a couple of interviews in the automation testing area. The offers were related to Java, spring boot 
            , and React. I decided to look for questions about Java to improve my theoric knowledge. There were 
            a few questions that I couldn't answer but I feel my performance was good for a Junior Dev. I demonstrate that
            I was doing an effort and I want to improve my skills. I used a lot of my soft skills to gain attention 
            and I never said that I don't have experience, I just used all the projects and all the information that I have
            gained around these seven months. 
        </p>

           <p>Also, I started an external course on full Java stack. That helps me to practice Java and the principles linke 
            SOLID and the fourth pillar. 
           </p>

           <p>For the offers, I learned that they use Selenium, RestAssured, and Jenkins in Automation. I watched some videos to have 
            an idea about how to manipulate them. Also, there are three kinds of tests: Unit test, integration test, and End to end test. 
            In addition, I watched some videos and make questions about what a QA engineer does or should know. That helped me to 
            give me an idea if I want to become one. 
           </p>

           <p>I'm really happy because I was selected for a team to do an app to enhance performance in production. It's a tool 
            that they will use to reduce the time of performance. I liked the project, and the people, and that I'll learn new things for a 
            future position with them. I should congratulate myself because I felt sometimes that this was too much, but I decided to try
            and do my best... that's the best I can do. 
           </p>
           <p>For next week, I'm planning to have a training for the new tools, an introduction to the team and I'll ask for pieces of advice 
            to learn these new tools. 
           </p>
