          <h6>This week I focus my attention to do three activities. 
            The first, I had a team project where we have to resolve
            five programming problems from google, and write them in Python, Kotlin, Dart, and TypeScript. 
            Second, build a blog to report my learning from now on. 
            The final, solve a programming google problem by myself. For this last, I especially have difficulty 
            building the algorithm. Then, I decide to study data structure to understand how 
            I can do a better approach to it. 
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Translating a log</h3>
          <p>In my team was decided to divided the problemas by small teams. 
            I chose to translate the problem d1000000 from Python to Typescript (TP). <br> 
            At first moment I thought would be easy
            because TS it's like JavaScript (JS) with some differences. 
          </p>
          <p>TS is a language pretty similar than JS. The main difference is that TS allows catching 
            errors in the syntaxis before running the code. Also, we have to specificate the type 
            of data we're using in a function, variables, objects or classes. <br>
            The console runs TS by transpiring code into JS. In a few words, it translates TS to JS.
          </p>
          <p>I have a few difficulties changing Python code into TS. My main problem was introducing the data
            from the terminal.
            I detected a big difference when we are just running a program without the HTML structure.
            I couldn't understand a prompt method, an alert, or document.write(). 
            My team and I discovered we have to build the communication with the console by a method named Readline
            in Node.js documentation. 
          </p>
          <code>
          const readline = require('readline'); <br>
            let rl = readline.createInterface(process.stdin, process.stdout);
          </code>
          <p><i><br>The output stream is used to print prompts for user input that arrives on, and is read from, 
            the input stream.
            From Node.js documentation
          </i></p>

          <code>
            const lines : string[] = [];<br>
            rl.on('line', line => lines.push(line)).on('close', () => runAllTests(lines));
          </code>
          <p><br>To catch inputs, we have to receive all the information in an array. Building an interface 
          we separate and organized every element the user typed. After all, we direct the data to the function we are using 
         to process the logic and get the answer to the problem. <br>
         Brings my attention, in python we only need input() command to catch information from the console, but 
         here we have to build the communication. We use many lines the code when in python we only use 1.<br>
         Another detail. Because we need to organize the information from the array, I feel the function that manipulates
         the data was more simplified than the operations in Python.</p>

         <p>In Addition, I learned how to use some tools. I confused the map method with the map class.
          It took me some time to realize my mistake. <br>
          <code>// Driver code<br>
            var arr = [ 11, 89, 23, 7, 98 ];
         
            <br>// use of map() method<br>
            var val = arr.map(Math.log)<br></code>
            <br>
            The last code is an example of how map method works. I was trying to use map to convert the data from the array
            into a number type. 
         </p>

         <h3 class="subtitle">The blog process</h3>
         <p>I really like this part. I know I have a lot to learn designing websites, even though I have fun when 
          I build someting with my design.<br><br>
          This blog right now I feel it's simple but I tried to make it responsible mobile and easy to read.
          I looked for a palette where the main color was degrate of pink.
         </p>
         <p> My learning with the blog was the existence of Github pages. I didn't know they were a host of websites. 
          I think I can have the advantage of this tool for personal projects such as my CV or an extensive portfolio. <br>
          I invested sometime from the week to refresh the tools to build a beautiful website but more about trying to 
          organized my ideas to set every element where I want as I was thinking or imaging.
         </p>
         <p>This isn't finish but for this week was a good start. I'll keep looking for elements or details that can bring 
          more power to this blog. 
         </p>

         <h3 class="subtitle">Data structure and algorithm learning</h3>
         <p>I feel this was my weakness point in the week. I realized how much information I have to shape to improve 
          my code speed. I watched a tutorial on youtube 
          <i>"Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges"</i>.
          I haven't finished it. I'm in the middle part but I feel it has great tools. Some of them are the next:
          <br>
          It gives a guideline to try solving memorization dynamic programming problems. 
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>Make it work </li>
          <li>Make it efficient</li>
         </ul>
         <p>It is recommendable to make it work we should try looking at these problems as a tree. For it, I discovered 
          <i>mindmeister</i> to do my maps. Then, I can figure out the logic. <br> I want to apply it to my own problem from 
        google jam. Also at this point, he suggests implementing the tree using recursion. Finally, test it to get correct answers.</p>

        <p>To make a problem efficient I should use a memo object. I feel this part right now it's a little hard to manipulate
          because I'm spending some time to make it work. It's more about figuring out the logic. <br><br>

          Right now my learn it is how to build a map to break down parts, understand the problem and find conditions. I'm 
          going to apply them to my own personal problems from google jam.
