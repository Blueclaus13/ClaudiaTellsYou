            <h3 class="subtitle">Building the last part in API</h3>
                <p>This week I spent hours working on my API. I finished the sort, filter, and 
                    pagination. My request was through a new GET by RequestMapping asking for params. 
                    It was a big question I had; How I would get the data when by the frontEnd
                    someone clicks a button?. I could answer by searching and asking. Someone told me 
                    about the params and I find too many options. After a few days, I could build a Get
                    with all the parameters I need. I found how to get the values of my LinkedHasmap, 
                    then I made a list that I modified by filters, sort, and pagination. 
                </p>
                <p>The sort made me feel frustrated many times. I looked at and read websites and videos. I 
                    When I tried something I had Errors coming and I couldn't understand what 
                    was wrong. When you build a simple program the debugging could be fast by the terminal, 
                    with spring and maven I have a big block of errors coming by Postman or the running console.
                    It's a pretty different method to figure out the error. I found it helpful to google the error, 
                    but sometimes the result it's too general. I imagine when you get more practice programming
                    you start understanding better the Error and the debugging method. In this case, I learned
                    the difference between a mutable list and an immutable. All this time I thought the comparison 
                    function had something wrong but it was the function sort, which needs a mutable list to work. 
                    When I asked for help they checked the indata, the out data and the error. It's something
                    I would do the next time. 
                </p>

                <p>Another situation I had was connecting the Backend (BE) with the frontEnd (FE). I used Axios
                    in the frontend for GET and POST. I had a bad_Request Error wich I couldn't fix by myself.
                    I thought it was the data I received so I looked at ways to change the data/date in some 
                    paramaters. After few hours, I decided to ask someone else. When we were in the meeting, 
                    we tried few things. First, we identified if the error was coming from the BE or FE. We used
                    print states to check if the request was reaching the GET in the BE. At the end, we visualized
                    it was from the FE. We did some console logs until figure out what the Error means. It
                    was something simple and silly. The URL needs the http:// before the port and the parameters. 
                </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Building the last part in frontEnd</h3>
                <p>When I returned to work in the Frontend, after a few weeks concentrated in the BE, I was
                    a little lost with react and my code. Some of the components and the data I needed where confused. 
                    It means I need to work more organizing my code in React. I understand it's becayse I was 
                    learning React. Well, I'm still learning.
