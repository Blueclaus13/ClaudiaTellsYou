        <h4>Team Work, and  Individual Code Jam Problem</h4>

          <h6>This week was focused to finish my individual code and cooperate
            with the resolution of 3 more codeJam problems.
            To accomplish it, I needed to study Algorimths and data structure.<br>
            Also, I finished some details from the blog. I try to organize better
            content and give understandable titles to the links.
      
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">My learning</h3>
          <p>The last week, I started a youtube video about dynamic 
            Algorimths to understant better how to neat the parts of my code. This week I 
            finished this tutorial. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with my team was easier than the last week. We had some meetings 
            to review the main problems on the 5 codeJam's problems. 
          </p>
          <p>I finished my individual code around Thursday because I had some blockers. 
            When I started coding on Tuesday, I did the first code where I tried to build a list
            with all the possible results. It worked for short inputs but It wasn't right
            with larger inputs. Later, I discovered some conditions in the problem. 
            Those helped me think of an algorithm to fix my problem. 
            I did a few more tries until Wednesday I had a solution and a running code with the right outputs. 
          </p>
          <p>By Thursday I had my final code but It didn't work in both tests in CodeJam. 
            I blamed the efficiency and I asked for help from my team. They explained to me about Big O notation
            and how to see what efficiency my code had. I realized my code had O(n^2). They tried to run my code, we realized my code wasn't completely right in all the outputs, it was the 
            reason for the failure. But All I did that day, helped me to 
            build a third program with better efficiency. I did a O(n). I was proud of myself.
          </p>
         <p>To build the third code I used a Class to capture the lists of data. 
         </p>
         <p>The final teamwork arrived in the middle of the week. Because I had some practice writing
          TypeScript code, I decided to translate EqualSum which is a dynamic program where the 
          program gives several outputs in the middle of the running code. My problem was that the
           readline request just read one time the input. I asked for help in my teamwork. We build a request console and all the code inside with control variables to decide when to close the input the program ends, as well. 
         </p>
         <p> In general, I felt rushed this week. When I was feeling with enough time to write
          my techLogs and fix details in my blog, we received more assignments to build in other 
          programming languages the individual problems as part of team's assignations. 
          I hope that the next week I can feel different to have my personal time free.
