          <h6>We're still working in the new App for the apprentice. We divide the work in some internal teams;
            The backend and The frontend. I decided to be in the Frontend because I have more experience
            designing Websites. 
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Designing</h3>
        <p>This is my favorite part of the web Development major. We decided to use Material UI and I like it. 
          Some frameworks help you to design faster, but I never used them before. I used to use
          my own knowledge of HTML and CSS, and recently React. Lately, I have read documents and websites of 
           style CSS. 
        </p>
        <p>Part of my job was looking for a website or place to do a mock. I saw too many. Actually,
          if I could pay for them, It would make it more easily. I like Figma but in the free version it doesn't have
          the tools I want. At the and, I decided to use LucyChart. This are the results of some of my mocks:

        </p>

        <div><img src="../images/dashboard.jpg" alt="Dashboard" style="width: 50%;"></div>

        <p>Our Dashboard is going to give the recent content in the app like a ticket, an assignment, or feedback. 
          In these pictures, you'll see a dashboard for the apprentice. A whole app is a new tool for the apprentice 
          some staff members. 
        </p>

        <div><img src="../images/dailyStatus.PNG" alt="DailyStatus" style="width: 50%;"></div>

        <p>Then, we have the daily status dashboard to make an area where the apprentice can report
          their work and also they can open a ticket for a blocker, making it easy to report an issue. 
        </p>
        <div><img src="../images/batch.PNG" alt="batch" style="width: 50%;"></div>
        <p>Last, we have a view of their classmates in the apprentice.</p>

        <p>There aren't my best designs but the real app looks so much better. 
          In the future, I expect to bring some
          photos of the app if my company allows them.  </p>
        

          <a id="topbutton" href="#top">Back to the Top </a>

          <h3 class="subtitle">Independient study</h3>
          <p>As I said I have study some CSS topics by myself. I used before tools like Grill and flex, but I don't 
            want to use them always when I need to align content. Then, I tried to reach some alignment using 
            css propeties. I get better idea of box-sizing propety. It works great for containers that have just 
            one Item and it goes out of the bord. 
          </p>
          <p>Also, I learned how to use Routers. We use two main routers /Dashboard and /loging. Right now, I'm working in 
            the Darshboard, I plan to add new routers for navigation around the app. That is the work for the next week. 
          </p>
