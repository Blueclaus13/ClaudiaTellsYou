          <h6>These week I continued studying Java. In my course of React I'm designing my own service with Java.
            Finally, with my course of Data structure I finished the excercises to learn about Trees. 
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Training Activities</h3>
        <p>This week I learned about Trees. Knowing how they work through building them in JS is really useful.
            <a href="https://replit.com/@ClaudiaDe8/NearTornCareware#index.js">Repository</a>. This was an extensive topic
        because designing a tree is pretty confusing. I understand the concept but in practice, I feel I need to learn
    more.  </p>

            <p>In my Java course, I'm practicing more about theory. In addition, I decided to build a service for 
                my projects in React. I'm using Spring boot and a MVC design. My goal for next week is to finish my React project
                with my own service. I feel is useful to add a database service. I'm connecting my service with Postgres.
                I used it in the To-Do app, I feel it's safe to use the same technology so I just sharpen my current skills
                for a better performance in an opportunity. By the way, I also started a service in NODE.js. I would like to finish it
                but I had some problems connecting the Database mongoose. I decided to keep my attention on React, it's better to do 
                a service with the tools that I know, and later I can refactor the projects with other technology.  
            </p>
            <p>Finally, my course in React goeas great. I'm practicing with a project that is in this Repository 
                <a href="https://github.com/Blueclaus13/01-starting-project">Start Project</a>
                I'm making a e-commers app to use Redux toolkit. Next week I expected to finish it so I can give you a technical log 
                about what I did and what technology I used. 
            </p>
