            <h4>Preparation to start new Project</h4>
            <h6>In general, this week was about learning new things. We received an assignment for an individual new Project.
                It consists to do an App "to-do list", from BackEnd to frontEnd. There are new tools I should learn how to use, like
                React, Spring and Maven. I need Java, and even though I know a little bit, I have to practice some exercises. 
                I decided to watch tutorials about React, Java, and Spring. I use Youtube and Oreilly.
                Also, I continue learning about Data structure.
                I classified the most common Big O notation, and some rules to build Efficient code. 
            </h6>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Learning React</h3>
                <p>Learning React was one of my favorite things tp do this week. I got excited to build more dynamic frontEnd code. 
                    I decided to watch youtube tutoriales because the Oreilly was too large. 
                    Anyway, I also watched some fragments from Oreilly, because 
                    They have some instructions I feel I need more explication or examples. 
                </p>
                <p>I may have to work on my definition but React is a JavaScript library for building 
                    user interfaces based on UI components. It creates an initial project whit a bunch of documents
                    where you find the initial structure of a website. It contains HTML pages, you can build dynamic
                    code because React has libraries that allow you to combine JS to give code interaction.  
                </p>
                <p>I already had one experience with Angular, which is a similar program. However, at that time I didn't
                    understand what was the intention of these libraries. Now, I can see the useful tools it provides. I did
                    this Blog without using React or Angular. As I was practicing some projects in React, I realized
                    that by building a new page for a website you can repeat some parts like the header, the footer, the title, 
                    or some code lines. You can reduce the effort by just having templates named components in React. For example,
                    if I make a calculator I can build a component named button and use the same component for most of
                    the calculator's buttons.You build your overall user interface by combaning these
                    building blocks. I feel that is really useful!! 
                </p>
                <p>I did 3 easly projects in React where I learned how to use variables calling JS functions and how to use Hooks.
                    I still need to learn more about hooks, props and dynamic place holders. 
                </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Big O notation</h3>
                <p>I'm watching a useful course about Data structure and algorithms. This week I learned about hot to
                    calculate the O(n), O(1), and (On^2). Big O notation is a graphic representation between Number of operations and 
                    the number of steps in the program. 
                </p>
                <p>I learned 4 rules to calculate O notation in my own code.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Worst Case </b>
                        Imagine the worst case to find or calculate data. 
                        The most possible operations our code could do. </li>
                    <li><b>Remove constants</b>
                         we should remove constants that don't affect our equation to have it simplified. </li>
                    <li><b>Different terms for inputs: O(a + b) </b> If I have two For(s) working with different 
                    data, they should be considered as O(n) because they are working with separate inputs</li>
                    <li><b>Drop Non-Dominants </b> I can't consider the O notation of low range.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>What is a good code</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Readable</li>
                    <li>Scalable - speed (time complexity) and memory (space complexity) --> Big O Efficiency</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Installation of Maven and initialize a Spring framework</h3>
                <p>This week I install some tools in my Computer. Marvel gave me some troubles because
                    I needed to give permission to my Terminal to read files. After, I could make a new project 
                    in IntelliJ using spring boot initializr. I got excited but at first time I feel I don't know nothing.
                    I watched some tutorials from Oreilly and they help giving me a first gaze about what it's and how to use it. 
                    I know it's a tool to separate the code by Service layers or "Service layers". I think it's helping
                    to organize the classes and files for knowing what it's what.
                </p>
                <p>I understand it's to connect our backEnd program with the application interface. </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Continue working</h3>
                <p>I can't say I finish all the tutorials and information I need. The next week I plan to start 
                    with the assignment, at less my first try. I wish I can do the visual structure in React 
                    and learn about how I can connect my code from React with the code from Java. 
                </p>
