        <h6>This technical Log is to explain the apprentice universe app that we started in January and finished the 
            first week of February. This is an extensive project in a short time but we are proud to present to you the results
            that we had. The functionality of this app is based on the need for a platform to help the training department
            of the company where I'm making my internship. The App is built with Java, Spring, and React technologies.
            In this short time, we also learned other technologies like Redux, PostgresSQL, Material UI, and dependency Jjwt. The main 
            challenge was to dominate the new tools and made present results every week to our client. This project was pretty different than 
            TODO app because I already have some knowledge about what to do. Around the project, we faced some difficulties with the times
            and results that we expected but as a team, we communicated together and made agreements to give results. I hope that you enjoy this reading
            as I did making this app.

          <p>
            Apprentice universe is an App developed to simplify company organization in the talent 
            development field. This refers to efforts to identify, train, and advance employees within the company.
             The client has an important need to control assignations to upskilling, and reskilling employees. 
             The main functionality consists in connecting this goal properly with all the possible situations
             that this relationship between the trainer, the process, and the organization would have;
              for example, we have four different kinds of users; apprentice, stakeholder, admin, and super admin. 
              We intent to give a tool where all these characters can interact each other with their own needs to 
              accomplish the training process.
          </p>
          <p>Also, is important to explain the main roles and app's items that we give for their functions.
            The apprentice is the training user who is receiving assignations, makes reports for the staff
             (stakeholders), and communicates issues around the training program. The stakeholder user manager 
             a number of apprentices named batches, their function consists in supervising by creating, scoring, 
             and giving feedback on assignments, receiving the tickets (it's how we named a blocker) or issues that 
             apprentices report, checking daily status and learned reports, and adding Frequently asked questions. 
             The admin section is divided between two users; admin and super admin. Admin is a user who can create 
             apprentices' users, batches, and stakeholders, and visualize their assignments, tickets, and daily reports. 
             Super Admin can manage the same that all other users but in addition, they can delete, change or archive
              information. </p>

                  <p>We decided to apply for our project The Agile Product RoadMap. 
                    It's a template where we can develop some strategic steps for our product and at the
                    same time receive feedback from our clients, every term. This roadmap type can shift
                    based on feedback. We consider that quality a tool to develop this project.

                    <p>As an entity (@Entity Annotation), the user model will have its own
                        repository, and is composed of the following fields: </p>

                 <p>The User model is general for every user in the database with some restrictions depending the user 
                    role. As an “Apprentice” we can only be part of one batch linking the batch_fk (foreign key)
                    field, whereas the other roles can own (but not be part of) different batches. In addition,
                     only Users with the role “Apprentice” can hold assignments. </p>

                <p>The way this user entity can hold e.g. several assignments is using 
                    a Set data structure, that will be linked through a table relationship.

                        <li>Many to Many Set “assignments” between User -Assignments: A user with the role “Apprentice” can have many Assignments entities stored and vice versa. </li>
                        <li>Many to One field “userBatch” between Batch -User: A user can have one batch assigned if the role is “Apprentice”, and a Batch can have several users. </li>
                        <li>One to Many Set “ownedBatches” between User -Batch: A user can own many Batches if the role is “Stakeholder”, “Admin”, or “Super admin” and the batch can only have 1 owner. </li>
                        <li>One to Many Set “tickets” between User - Tickets: A user can have many tickets, but the ticket can only have one user. </li>
                        <li>Element Collection (One to Many) “learned_today” relationship between User -LearnedToday: A user can own several LearnedToday instances. </li>
                        <li>Element Collection (One to Many) “daily_status” relationship between User - DailyStatus: A user can own several DailyStatus instances. </li>

                As an embeddable model (@Embeddable Annotation), 
                it won't have its own repository, instead, 
                it will be embedded as a Set, that is to say, a Table in each user model. 
                It is composed of the following fields: </p>

             <p>The way this assignment entity can hold e.g., several users is using a Set data structure,
                 that will be linked through a table relationship. The relationships this entity has are the following: </p>

         <ul>
             <li>Many to Many Set “apprentices” between Assignments - Users: An assignment can have

            <li>Element Collection (One to Many) “assignment_solutions” relationship between Assignment
                 - AssignmentSolution: An assignment can own several AssignmentSolution instances. </li>
                
        </ul>

        <p>In addtition, this model can have other fields 
            depending if the assignment is an individual assignment,
             batch assignment or weekly assignment: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Batch_fk: If the assignment is a batch assignment, it will have a One
                 to Many relationship with Batch, which means a Batch can have many assignments,
                  but the assignment can only have 1 batch. </li>
            <li>Individual: The user UUID if the assignment is individual. </li>

        <p>AssignmentSolution model - Embeddable Join Table <br>
 
            As an embeddable model (@Embeddable Annotation), it won't have its own repository, instead, 
            it will be embedded as a Set, that is to say, a Table in each assignment model. It is composed of the following fields: </p>
            <div><img src="../images/ApprenticeUniverse/Screen Shot 2023-02-07 at 21.47.10.png"
                alt="workflow" style="width: 30%;"></div> 
    <p>apprentice_assignments - Join Table <br>
 
        This is the result of the Many to Many relationships between User and Assignment, 
        it holds the relation between its UUIDs. </p>

<p>Batch model - Entity 
 
    As an entity (@Entity Annotation), the assignment model will have its 
    own repository, and is composed of the following fields: </p>
            
    <div><img src="../images/ApprenticeUniverse/Screen Shot 2023-02-07 at 21.48.42.png"

    <p>
        The way this Batch entity can hold e.g. several users is using a Set data
         structure, that will be linked through a table relationship. The 
         relationships this entity has are the following: 
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>Many to One field “user_fk” between Batch - User: 
            A batch can only have one user and a user can have many Batches if the role is “Stakeholder”, “Admin”, or “Super Admin”. </li>
        <li>One to Many Set “assignments” between Batch - Assignment:
             A batch can own many Assignments and an assignment can only own one batch. </li>
        <li>One to Many Set “apprentices” between Batch - User: A batch 
            can have many apprentices whereas a User with role “Apprentice” can only have one batch. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>FAQ model - Entity <br>
        As an entity (@Entity Annotation), the FAQ model will have its own repository,
         and is composed of the following fields: </p>

    <p>It is the only table that does not hold any relationship as it doesn't 
        have any relevant information or linkage with the other entities. </p>

    <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>DTOs</h5>

    <p>It is not always a good idea for our API to expose the database entities to the client. 
        Sometimes we want to change the type of data sent to the client, for example hiding sensitive data and
         sending only what is necessary.  To achieve this, we can use a DTO which is an object that defines 
         how the data will be sent over the network.  </p>

    <p>The DTOs that we created aim to hide sensitive information to the client, and only provide what is necessary, 
        as you can see below,we have the full details which protect the entity layer,
         and short details for providing only the information that is needed. </p>

<h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>Repositories</h5>
<p>In the repository layer, we annotate our interface with the @Repository annotation 
    to let know Spring through classpath scanning that this will be a repository. 
    Then, we extend our interface to the CrudRepository from JPA so we can use filtering,
     paginating and functions for querying specific data that are methods included with the JPA dependency.
      The purpose of this layer is for providing pre-built functionality & other convenient 
      features for querying, altering, & accessing your data from a connected data base or other 
      data storage system. In our case via this repository, we make queries to the PostgreSQL database,
       the crud repository saves us from manually writing the queries. Additionally, in the repositories 
       we used projections to send back data to the client in form of a DTO rather than directly sending the
        entity that will be explained in the following section. </p>

        <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>Spring Data JPA - Class based Projection </h5>

        <p>As we stated before, the goal of a DTO class is to provide an efficient and strongly 
            typed representation of the data returned by a query. A DTO consists of a set of attributes, 
            getters and setters and a constructor to set all of the class attributes. In order to use a 
            specific DTO for projection you need to type an SQL query, but instead of selecting as we would 
            normally do, we need to use a constructor expression in the query. It describes a call of the constructor.
             It starts with the keyword new, followed by the DTO class's fully-qualified class name and 
             a list of constructor parameters this is executed by using the @Query annotation. The persistence provider
              then executes a query that selects the columns mapped by the referenced entity attributes and 
              executes the described constructor call. 
        </p>

        <p>These projections can be seen in the repository files of the project, we need to explicitly 
            state in our DTO class what kind of information we need, then in our repository we can start 
            writing a query with the @Query annotation. To better understand the instance method by SQL query
             we can see this example: </p>

        <p>SELECT new com.apprenticeplatform.dtos.ShortBatchDetail(b.id, b.batchName, b.description, 
            bo.id, bo.firstName, bo.lastName, b.active) FROM Batch b JOIN b.batchOwner bo WHERE b.active = true </p>
        <p>As we can see, we need to instance our DTO making use of the new keyword, followed by the path
             where our DTO is and explicitly populating the fields our DTO needs to be built using the SQL query.
              Note that data types pulled from our tables need to strictly match for the DTO data types to be built. 
              This way we can extract any information we need from our tables without only relying on the JPA interface 
              built in methods. </p>

        <p>The service layer is there to provide logic to operate on the data sent to and from
             the data access object and the client. This is good practice arising from what is
              known as the single responsibility principle. The Service layer's single responsibility
               is to do any logic required with the data received by the Controller. We use layers to 
               allow us to abstract away the underlying implementation so we that we can easily change it. 
               This way the controller layer will not be implementing any logic, and instead directly call 
               the methods from our services. </p>

        <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>Services </h5>
        <p>Frontend: This is something that I would have liked to fix in time. I forgot to fix the 
          problem with the buttons that aren't hidden when a module comes out. <br>
          Also, sometimes the application didn't reload when it was a new time or when you clicked Done/Undone 
          It happened because I used a variable that in time doesn't change because the component isn't active. 
          I should connect better that section. It's because I have to practice the use of hooks, and I might need
          to understand better how the hooks are working in React. Moreover, I should make betters practices when I'm building
          components, it would make it easy to fix and get improvements in the code. 
          </p>

          <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>Security </h5>

          <p>Here are the contents of the config package. </p>

          <div><img src="../images/ApprenticeUniverse/Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 10.56.54.png"
            alt="workflow" style="width: 30%;"></div> 

          <p>This part of the application focuses on configuring the REST API's security to meet our needs. </p>

          <p>Initially in our User entity we implement User Details 
            to store user information which is later encapsulated into Authentication objects.  </p>

            <p>Files:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>ApplicationConfig: In this file we declare @Beans that we will later use 
                    in the other configuration files. The following are the Beans declared: 
                    userDetailsService() for finding the user by email address, authenticationProvider()
                     a class that can process a single Authentication implementation, here we set 
                     the UserDetailsService (email), and password to perform authentication. authenticationManager() 
                     container for authentication providers, giving a consistent interface to them all,
                      and passwordEncoder() which uses BCryptPasswordEncoder() to save the user's hashsed 
                      password to the database. </li>
                <li>JwtAuthenticationFilter: In this class we extend the OncePerRequestFilter
                     which tells SpringBoot, so that we guarantee that our specified filter is
                      executed once per given request. In the overridden method doFilterInternal()
                       we extract the header from the client request, we check for “Bearer” at the 
                       beginning of the header if it's not present it will simply continue with the 
                       rest of the filters, otherwise it will begin extracting the username and checking
                        if it's in the database, if this is succesfull then we generate a new token,
                         and set the token details to be sent back to the client. </li>
                <li>SecurityConfiguration: In this class we will use some of the beans declared 
                    in the Application config, in the method securityFilterChain is where we really 
                    configure our app's security, the first thing that we do is disable the cors and 
                    csrf, then using the requestMatchers, we specify any endpoints that we want to 
                    leave without security such as login and register. Then we secure the rest of 
                    the endpoints so that all users must be authenticated to access such endpoints. 
                    Before the http.build() we add more information, we pass in the authenticationProvider
                     bean, and also specify to add the jwtAuthFilter. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is important to note that in order for this to 
                successfully work prior to this we had utilized the services specific for the authentication. </p>

                <div><img src="../images/ApprenticeUniverse/Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 10.57.06.png"

                <p>Files:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>AuthenticationService: In this class we refer back to some 
                        of the beans created in config and have two main methods,
                         register and authenticate. In the register() method we take 
                         in a request which includes all of the user info, and where we
                          save the user to the repository, we also generate a jwt token.
                           Here an AuthenticationResponse is getting prepared to be sent 
                           back with the jwt token. In the authenticate() method we take
                            in a request containing an email and a password and then we check if 
                            the user is valid, then we generate a token and send it to the client. </li>
                    <li>JwtService: This class has methods that deals with the aspects of token generation, 
                        checking if it's valid, the expiration, adding specific claims to be sent back to the client. </li>
                </ul>

        
    <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>Database </h5>

        <h1 class="subtitle" id="frontend">Frontend</h1>

       <p>For the frontend of this application the following technologies were used: </p>
       <ul>
        <li>JavaScript. </li>
        <li>ReactJS. </li>
        <li>Redux. </li>
        <li>Material UI. </li>
        <li>Axios. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The application was created with the React.js framework, with the source code written
        in JavaScript. The build tool used to compile the project was create-react-app.  </p>

    <p>Material UI was chosen as the React UI framework library to create most of the UI 
        related components. Material UI offers components out-the-box components that facilitate the 
        creation and design of the application. The documentation on Material UI and its use can found
         <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/"> Material UI here</a> </p>

         <p>Most of the data and the states used to store said data were handled with the Redux
             library. And the data was passed between the front and the backend with the help of library Axios. </p>

        <p>For managing the authentication, we used jwt-decode library, which manages 
            the transfer of JWT tokens between the front end of the application and the API. 
        </p>

        <p>Every dependency used for the application can be found on the dependencies section 
            inside the package.json file located on the root of the project. </p>

                  <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>Styles</h5>
                  <p>For styles we have 2 style files and one theme component to manage the style of Material UI components.  </p>

                  <p style="background-color: pink;">App Style</p>
                  <p>This file contains the style of app component. It's the body of our application.
                     Also, some other lines that style classes
                    form material UI and change specific colors that are default in that library. </p>
                    <div><img src="../images/ApprenticeUniverse/Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.51.55.png"
                        alt="workflow" style="width: 30%;"></div> 
                    <p style="background-color: pink;">LOGGING Style</p>

                    <P>There is an animation that you can see when you sign in the application.
                         As you are waiting for the sign in request 
                        it's present routing. This is built whit CSS. You can find the file in src/styles/loader </P>

                        <p style="background-color: pink;">Theme Style</p>

                        <p>In the header of some components, you will find this function: </p>
                        <br>
                        <code>const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({}); 
                        </code><br>
                        <p>It's a style hook that we use to set style in the specific components 
                            where we mark using a class. We build a specific class name “classes” </p>

                        <br>
                        <code>const classes = useStyles(); 
                        </code><br>

                        <p>When we want to style a component, we just add 
                            in ClassName={classes.itemExample}, and we add “itemExample”
                             inside the MakeStyles like this </p>

                        <br>
                        <code>onst useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({ <br>
 
                            ItemExample: theme.pallete.primary.main, 
                             <br>
                            }); 
                        </code><br>

                        <p>When we selected a specific color from the theme it goes for the default
                             theme that material UI has. In our case we wanted a specific theme. Material UI 
                            has the option to set a custom theme. We built a theme component that you can find in src/theme.js </p>
                           

                            <h5 class="subsubtitle"> >>Routes </h5>

                            <p>There are several routes inside the front application. The routes were 
                                implemented using React Router. Most
                                 of the code implementation for the user routes can be found on the dashboard files 
                                 for each user role.  </p>

            <p>For example, for the Apprentice role routes, go to the src/pages/DashboardApprentice directory where the 
                DashApprentice.js file will contain the logic involved to handle all the Apprentice related routes. </p>

        <p>Each route serves its purpose and some 
            routes are only accessible by certain roles. Here are most of the routes and their use: </p>

                <li>/app/faq: This route contains a FAQ section for the Apprentices, where both the Admins and
