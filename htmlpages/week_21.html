          <h6>This week I'm going to talk about my experience with open source,
            what I did in my first pull request, how do I feel looking for an 
            active project.
          </h6>

        <h3 class="subtitle">My Research</h3>
        <p>Open source is a big world. I searched for a list of several projects
          looking for an issue or something that I could do. I think that 
          the projects are bigger than I imagined. 
        </p>
        <p>My strategy to find a repository was to post a comment on every kind of issue I felt it suit me.
          It would be my first time, so I needed something easy to understand how to manage the pull request 
        for a project that I didn't build with a team.  </p>

        <p>My first pull request was really easy, but it took me a day to understand the 
          project and its construction. I learned that we need to build an environment to install 
          dependencies and run in an exclusive part of the program. 
        </p>
       <p>Also, I learned about another kind of files (.rst)
        "An RST file is a text file that contains code written in the reStructuredText markup language". Whit 
        it you can build HTML files that build your web page. This kind of thing made me spend time understanding 
        the project's construction. 
       </p>
       <p>My first impression of this assignment was that "it would be easy". Now, I think it'
        complicated to look for help because nobody understands the project so you should struggle
        with the setup or the issue request. The most difficult thing is to resolve questions 
        in the instructions or issues' request. I guess I have to check these questions with 
       the managers in the project or other people. I'm asking myself how to build doubts whitout sound
       too fool. This is the difficult part, interacting with people 
       that I don't know/trust to demonstrate my vulnerabilities.</p>

       <p>For my first request, it wasn't too bad. It was just to correct a reference in a file.
        The difficult part was to understand the code. It was a project in Python, but when I see the files
        .rst I was confused about how it was built. 
       </p>
        <p>When I did my pull request I felt really happy because It was a big aproached
           but also alrealized that this issue was too easy and I struggled for almost a day. 
           Then, right now I feel pretty afraid bout my next pull request in java. It's more confusing. 
           I already have assigned an issue in Java to serialize a module. It's a good first issue in Java. 
           It's excited but also I'm confused about how or where to start. However, that's going to be
           an enter for the next essay. 
        </p>
