            <h4>Developing App's BackEnd Part 1</h4>
            <h6>In general, this week was about learning new things, again. I built some classes to make e 
                microService. They are the controller, repository, and service. I was confused about what was the 
                difference between repository and service. It was because of this project, for now, couldn't 
                build the Database. To understand well everything I follow some tutorials from Oreilly and 
                websites with a good explication about how to connect everything. I had some blockers
                understanding those things, so I couldn't finish the whole backend. I expected to go faster the next 
                week.

            <h3 class="subtitle">Learning Spring</h3>
                <p>This week I had a blocker when I was building my classes. I saw the Oreilly tutorials but 
                    I couldn't connect the examples with my needs. I understand it was because I couldn't define
                    where to build the logic of my app. </p>
                <p> I asked for help from my peers, and they explained to me what they were doing and which tutorials
                    helped him to build something. I did the same, I watched a youtube tutorial. There, they 
                    build some files like controller, service, and repository. I followed everything using JPA 
                    dependency, then I asked for help with something and someone told me I don't suppose to use
                    that dependency because It was a database. I had to change some things. Next, I worked
                    to build something similar but using my own method instead of calling 
                    the database dependency. 
                </p>
                <p> Making this mistake help me to understand what was the repository. I heard the meaning in 
                    Oreilly tutorial but I was just trying to repeat the concept without understanding. 
                    After I see the methods from the dependency and I could make run my backend app, I got it.
                </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Learning Axio for React</h3>
            <p> Finally, I could finish most part of my front end. 
                I uploaded everything to a repository in GitHub. I was a little confused because 
                the project was heavy. and I had some wear git responses. </p>
                <p>The other blocker was a break that my app had when I post something. I could make work 
                    the Get but the Post was broken when I summited.  </p>
            <p> I fixed the problem with help. It was because my post had the same data with a different type.
                This problem helped me to learn how to do debugging in React. Sometimes React tells you 
                exactly what is the problem or you can google the problem and find solutions. In some classes, 
                you should read the output from Postman. I didn't pay attention to the message from Postman, 
                I was focused on React. Whit some help I fixed the problem. I liked. 
            </p>
                

            <h3 class="subtitle">Summary</h3>
            <p>Sincerly this week was frustrating with all the new concepts. I was afraid to lose time 
                in simple and silly mistakes. Especially because as a concept understanding I couldn't 
                get as fast as I would like
                </p>

            <p>This week I planned to finish the backend and start making approaches to connect the backend and 
                    the frontend.
