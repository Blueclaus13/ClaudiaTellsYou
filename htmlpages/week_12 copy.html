          <h6>
            This week I worked in the frontend connecting the Api with the components
            in React. Everything was going find, but I discovered that I had 
            a mistake in the design of my components, they were all general for
            use in other views. Also, I want to talk about the skills for Teamwork
            that we're using to design everything and put the puzzle of our 
            App together.  
          </h6>
          <h3 class="subtitle">React Router</h3>
          <p>This is a new tool that I'm learning to use in React. It helps to build the 
            App's routs that our client will see when they navigate through it.  
          </p>
          <p>When I started building the componentes I wasn't aware about how to 
            use Reouter. Then, I designed my componentes pretty different that I need
            to implement the tool. Actually, there wasn't too much for fixing 
            but it cost me time. Remember that we just have a week to deliver This
            new app. I learned that I have to search for new technology when 
           I start a new project. That way, I don't have to come backwords to fix
         details that I could prevent.   </p>

         <p>I'm trying to make a clean code with every component that I'm building. 
          For exmaple, in the styles I'm using Usestyles hook. If I need to make a change 
          in the style with this hook is easier by using a theme. 
         </p>
          
        <a id="topbutton" href="#top">Back to the Top </a>
          

         <h3 class="subtitle">TeamWork</h3>

         <p>I discovered that sometimes is pretty difficult to work as a team. 
          We should have really good communication to connect all the pieces 
          together. For example, my team divided the work in two sections. Half 
          of the team is working in the frontend and the other half in the backend. 
          This week we connected the Api and some details happened. First, the Front's port 
          didn't have access to the database. My team did some calls to check if 
          everyone had access. Another issue was that some endpoints didn't work. This 
          situation was because the DTO haven't a data that the frontend needs. Also,
          the details in the front, where I discover I need to use something calls
          React Redux. This is a tool that allows me to check the changes in the Api. 
         </p>
         <p>All those details were happening and that's part of the process. That teaches
          us how to handle setbacks together. I'm pretty proud of my team because we're looking
           to help each other try to have options when someone is stuck. Finding solutions 
           and giving time to help is an environment that can't be another thing than success. 
         </p>

         <p>This week we have some issues with the frontend because I didn't know some tools 
          that exist to fix problems that I didn't know they could happend. I learned how useful
          is to make time to learn them. My future Claudia will be prepared to make it better.  
         </p>
